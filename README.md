OpenAI Onboarding App MVP

Live Demo: https://open-ai-onboarding-app-mvp.vercel.app/

Overview

Interactive onboarding prototype designed to map builder intent to the most relevant OpenAI tools and starting paths.

Built as an experiment to reduce friction between “I have an idea” and “I know where to start.”

Problem

New builders often struggle to translate high-level ideas into concrete starting points within AI platforms. Documentation explains features, but not decision pathways.

This prototype tests a guided flow that:

• Asks what the builder wants to create
• Identifies the relevant capability category
• Surfaces appropriate tools and next steps

What It Demonstrates

• Developer empathy and use case mapping
• Activation-focused UX thinking
• Lightweight API integration via server-side routes
• Rapid prototyping with Next.js and Vercel

Tech Stack

Next.js
Server-side API route integration
OpenAI API
Vercel deployment

How It Works

User selects what they want to build

The app routes them through structured intent questions

Backend logic maps intent to relevant tools and guidance

Status

Prototype built to explore AI onboarding design patterns.
Live and iterating.
